# django-registration

It is actually an implementation of elliptic curve cryptography(thanks to github user who created pyseccure)

users can Upload files 

and 

encrypt it using a key which is generated by site

also will be able to decrypt it.


if we give the public key of another user

the encrypted file can only be decrypted by that user's account..:)

and users can register (thanks to github user who created django registration)

There are errors in this which I am not planning to remove...

The name django registration since I copied django-registration from the real django registration I bulid the rest on top of it and didn't changed the name..

If anyone looking for django registration go to the real one...
